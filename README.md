# Hi there 👋  

I'm **Anom Suryadinata**, 23 years old, living in the tropical island of **Bali** 🌴.  
I love Coffee (Obviously) & I prefer it cold not by choice, but by climate (it can get quite hot in here, help)    

I'm a **self-taught software engineer** who likes to poke around in many fields (sometimes they poke back with bugs 🐛):  
- I've been writing coffee language **Java!** for 7+ years (mostly closed source so far, but I dream of open-sourcing in the future!)  
- Also juggles in **Luau** (Roblox games), **JavaScript & PHP** (web stuff), and **Rust** ([bevy](https://bevy.org/) & embedded programming)  
- Have some hands-on experience with **microcontrollers** and **IoT projects**, I enjoy the coding part more than the soldering part
